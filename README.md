# extension-messaging
Provides a template for browser extension message passing directly to and from a native page's execution context

Despite what appears to be the common consensus that you cannot pass data between an extension's content page and the native page's execution context, this template for message passing shows you how using the little utilized "CustomEvent" class to pass data through the "detail" parameter via event listeners attached to the dom's window which both context's have access to. Furthermore, injecting the script like shown bypasses the CSP which is a known vulnerability in Chrome browsing extensions. This gives your extension access to the variables and hooks into function calls directly in the native page and can pass that data back up to the content page, then to the background page, and from there to your own generated page (the options page in the example). From there you can send messages all the way back down the pipe to execute functions or access data on the native page.
